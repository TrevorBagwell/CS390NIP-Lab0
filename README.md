For the Custom nueral net, I implemented the sigmoid functions, the predictions algorithms and the training algorithms using the algorithms provided on the slides. I commented literally every single function given to me so I don't remember which one is mine and which is yours. But, it is beautiful and works like a charm with 90%+ accuracy and a high F1Scores.

For the Keras nueral net, I was able to implement a double layer nueral net with a single relu function on the first layer and a softmax function on the second layer that is able to achieve 98.5% with only 20 epochs and minibatch sizes of 32. This is annoying to run. It takes a long time. I used all the Keras functions provided in the slides to achieve this.
